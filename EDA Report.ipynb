    "\n",
    "This report is an initial examination of peer assessment using Vision 2030 data points of interest. Our goal is to identify institutions comparable to FSU in terms of similarity on institutional characteristics. The results are not meant to be conclusive, but to inform further interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address institutions comparable to FSU, we must address how institutions vary. What follows is a multivariate exploratory data analysis of institutional characteristics. These patterns are used to inform a peer matching strategy.\n",

    "The population of institutions is [Carnegie R1 Institutions](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/basic-classification/) captured in IPEDS. The sample size is 146.\n",

    "There are two broad areas of interest reflected in metrics: research activity and academic characteristics.\n",

    "\n",
    "We first examine the accuracy of [Principal Component Analysis on Metrics of Interest](#principal-component-analysis-on-metrics-of-interest). This section provides an initial view of the correlation structure of institutional research metrics. It is observed that certain metrics appear tightly correlated (Articles/Faculty, Citations/Faculty, and Awards/Faculty) while others lack strong correlations with other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed by a closer look at the [Correlation Structure](#correlational-eda) of groups of metrics by similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional exploratory step looks for [IPEDS Metrics](#ipeds) showing high correlations with the primary metrics, which introduces additional avenues of analysis.\n",

    "## Principal Component Analysis on Metrics of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimension reduction technique which produces a representation of data with fewer columns. The reduced representation of data is created by taking weighted averages of initial data columns in a way known to be the optimal linear reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n",
    "  <summary>PCA Primer</summary>\n",
    "  <div style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is useful in situations where data is thought to operate in a lower-dimensional space than how it presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be shown, for instance, that the `Books/Faculty` metric and the `Chapters/Faculty` metrics are highly correlated. In a PCA model, those two columns could be represented by a single column which is able to recover the original two columns with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given initial columns of data, PCA models are applied to estimate a desired number of output columns called the `rank` of the model. The lowest rank that is able to model the dataset is thought to be the underlying dimensionality of the data. Having a low-rank model also simplifies analysis and can mitigate issues like missingness and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of model rank is a tradeoff between dimension reduction and retained accuracy. PCA is typically applied at varying ranks less than the original dimensionality of the data. The marginal contribution of each additional low-rank dimension is typically viewed in a [Scree Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree_plot). We will use a modified approach to observe the reconstruction accuracy of the original data columns as $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data which can be reduced to one or two dimensions can then be plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a multivariate technique, meaning it is used to analyze a dataset in its entirety rather than to predict a single outcome. Further, it is pure calculation. The model does not require any assumptions be made about the underlying data. You can always apply PCA, and whether the result accurately models the data or not, it will always produce the optimal linear combinations for the chosen rank. In particular, PCA is not an inferential model and does not test a hypothesis or produce a p-value. It can most properly be thought of as a summarization technique like a correlation or a median. The other major dimension reduction technique, Factor Analysis, is the appropriate choice for building a theoretical model based on an assumed probability distribution of the data. Thus PCA has a tendency to be applied in areas where the goal is accurate modeling of data versus Factor Analysis being used when trying to develop a theoretical model of the phenomenon underlying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, any time PCA is applied, a Factor Analysis style interpretation is inescapable. The lower-dimensional representation of data is intuitively interpreted as latent factors in an implicit theoretical model of the data. Because PCA produces orthogonal components, the model can be thought of as finding the underlying axes along which the data varies. We do not try to avoid these interpretations, and somewhat improperly call dimension-reduced representations \"constructs\". Ultimately, we do not need principal components to have genuine theoretical meaning, we only need them to be useful representations of covariance structure.\n",

    "Models are trained at various ranks. To the far right of the chart, models trained with the same rank as the number of columns are able to perfectly represent the dataset because no dimension reduction has actually occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you move to the left, the dashed black line shows the overall reconstruction accuracy decreasing. The solid lines show the decreasing accuracy of reconstructing each individual metric, which clearly lose accuracy at different rates. The final rank-1 model has converged on retaining accuracy of Articles, Citations, and Awards, which can reproduce those columns at $R^2 > .9$. Those three features essentially dominate the rank-1 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other research metrics are modeled with varying accuracy. The lowest accuracy metrics, Phase 2 Expenditures and Professional Doctorates Awarded, were de-emphasized by the model in order to focus on the better-estimated metrics. Phase 1 and 2 Expenditures show early and dramatic divergence, suggesting they cannot be modeled as linear combinations of the better-estimated metrics.\n",

    "Beyond those observations, no other relationships convincingly emerge. Many of the pairwise relationships appear essentially random. What this suggests is that per-faculty metrics for conference proceedings, clinical trials, books/chapters, and phase 2 expenditures may represent fairly independent axes of variation. Having multiple irreducible dimensions against which to compare institutions adds complication to the search for peers. The isolated nature of these metrics means that a dimension-reduction approach will likely ignore these in favor of Type I metrics, which are more readily modeled as low-rank. This behavior is observed in the [comparison of PCA models on research metrics](#perfac_yoho). On the other hand, retaining these as independent metrics will require a different analysis approach to handle more than two dimensions. These two options yield the two peer selection strategies we will later pursue.\n",

For instance, consider that the strongest correlation in our data so far is between `Graduation Rate` and `Pell Graduation Rate`. The high correlation is to be expected. Now consider IPEDS data, which includes graduation rates calculated on nearly every possible combination of race, gender, age, residency, etc. We are sifting through thousands of additional metrics and selecting hundreds, but redundancy keeps things simple.

    "## Principal Component Analysis on Metrics of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimension reduction technique which produces a representation of data with fewer columns. The reduced representation of data is created by taking weighted averages of initial data columns in a way known to be the optimal linear reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n",
    "  <summary>PCA Primer</summary>\n",
    "  <div style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is useful in situations where data is thought to operate in a lower-dimensional space than how it presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be shown, for instance, that the `Books/Faculty` metric and the `Chapters/Faculty` metrics are highly correlated. In a PCA model, those two columns could be represented by a single column which is able to recover the original two columns with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given initial columns of data, PCA models are applied to estimate a desired number of output columns called the `rank` of the model. The lowest rank that is able to model the dataset is thought to be the underlying dimensionality of the data. Having a low-rank model also simplifies analysis and can mitigate issues like missingness and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of model rank is a tradeoff between dimension reduction and retained accuracy. PCA is typically applied at varying ranks less than the original dimensionality of the data. The marginal contribution of each additional low-rank dimension is typically viewed in a [Scree Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree_plot). We will use a modified approach to observe the reconstruction accuracy of the original data columns as $R^2$.\n",

    "PCA is a multivariate technique, meaning it is used to analyze a dataset in its entirety rather than to predict a single outcome. Further, it is pure calculation. The model does not require any assumptions be made about the underlying data. You can always apply PCA, and whether the result accurately models the data or not, it will always produce the optimal linear combinations for the chosen rank. In particular, PCA is not an inferential model and does not test a hypothesis or produce a p-value. It can most properly be thought of as a summarization technique like a correlation or a median. The other major dimension reduction technique, Factor Analysis, is the appropriate choice for building a theoretical model based on an assumed probability distribution of the data. Thus PCA has a tendency to be applied in areas where the goal is accurate modeling of data versus Factor Analysis being used when trying to develop a theoretical model of the phenomenon underlying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, any time PCA is applied, a Factor Analysis style interpretation is inescapable. The lower-dimensional representation of data is intuitively interpreted as latent factors in an implicit theoretical model of the data. Because PCA produces orthogonal components, the model can be thought of as finding the underlying axes along which the data varies. We do not try to avoid these interpretations, and somewhat improperly call dimension-reduced representations \"constructs\". Ultimately, we do not need principal components to have genuine theoretical meaning, we only need them to be useful representations of covariance structure.\n",
